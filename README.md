# icebreaker-react-native

## Never run out of things to say

A rewrite of my Icebreaker application in React native (from native android Kotlin)

## Description

Icebreaker is an app allowing you to loop through questions and games in casual conversations, on the dating scene nor with group of friends to easily get conversations going and avoid those awkward silences.

The application gives you random but customized questions and games based on any topics you want (or don't want) and are ranked in 3 categories based on the social context: Casual questions, Deep/Personal questions and Group games.

This is my first React native application, coming from someone with mostly regular React experience.
